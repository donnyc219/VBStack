# VBStack
A very basic stack

I am a beginner of Swift. As a practice I created a Stack class because I found Swift has no Stack class.

Don't treat it as very sophisticated, or advanced, or perfect Stack. I just created it as a practice of Swift.

Feel free to use it, modify it or do anything with it.
